# Car Insurance Qualification Program

## Description
This Python program determines if an individual qualifies for car insurance based on a series of inputted criteria. The user is prompted to provide their age, whether they have had any DUIs, and how many speeding tickets they possess. The program then evaluates this information against specific rules: the applicant must be older than 15, must not have any DUIs, and must have three or fewer speeding tickets. A boolean expression evaluates these conditions and determines qualification status. The result, either "true" or "false", indicates whether the applicant qualifies for car insurance.
