# This program evaluates if an applicant qualifies for car insurance based on specific criteria.

# Ask the applicant for their age.
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

# Ask the applicant if they have ever had a DUI. Convert the input to a boolean.
had_dui = input("Have you ever had a DUI? (yes/no) ").lower() == "yes"

# Ask the applicant how many speeding tickets they have.
speeding_tickets = int(input("How many speeding tickets do you have? "))

# Check if the applicant qualifies for car insurance based on the criteria:
# Must be over 15 years old, no DUIs, and no more than 3 speeding tickets.
qualifies = age > 15 and not had_dui and speeding_tickets <= 3

# Print the result of the boolean expression to determine qualification.
print("Qualified?")
